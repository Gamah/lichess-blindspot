## The contract with lichess

The lichess API is the canonical contract; this file loses to it. Re-derive from
https://lichess.org/api rather than from memory, and from lila source when the
apidoc is silent.

Facts established 2026-08-14 by reading lila at `lichess-org/lila@master`:

- `GET /api/games/user/{u}` is `OpenOrScoped` — **no token required**, games are
  public. Anon rate limit 25 games/sec, 60 for your own games with a token.
  One concurrent export per IP (`GlobalConcurrencyLimitPerIpAndUserOption`).
- `evals=true` adds an `analysis` array, one entry per ply, from
  `modules/analyse/src/main/JsonView.scala`:
  `{eval|mate, best (uci), variation (SAN, <=12 plies), judgment}`.
  Defaults to **false** on the by-user export — pass it explicitly.
- Semantics, from `modules/fishnet/src/main/AnalysisBuilder.scala`:
  - `eval` is the score **after** that ply, normalised to **White's POV**
    (odd plies are inverted). So lila's `winningChances.povDiff` drops in
    unmodified.
  - `variation` is the engine PV **from the position before that ply**, and is
    **empty when the played move was the engine's first choice**. So
    `variation.length > 0` is exactly lila's `hasCompChild(prev)` test.
  - `best` is `variation[0]`.
- `POST /:id/request-analysis` is `AuthOrScoped(_.Web.Mobile)` — the official app
  only. **We can never queue server analysis.** That is why the engine runs here.
- `division=true` gives `{middle, end}` plies, used to skip opening-book moves.
- Masters explorer is `https://explorer.lichess.ovh/masters?fen=...`, CORS-open,
  no auth.
- A request with **no User-Agent gets 404**, not 403 — lila's `NoCrawlers`
  guard. Browsers always send one, so this only ever bites dev scripts and
  curl, but the status code makes it look like the user doesn't exist.
- Exceeding the one-concurrent-export limit returns
  `429 {"error":"Please only run 1 request(s) at a time"}`. Distinct from the
  per-second rate limit and worth reporting to the user differently.

**Not yet verified against the live API.** Everything above is read from lila
source. The dev host these notes were written on could not complete a single
request to the games export (permanently 429, shared egress IP), so the field
semantics have never been checked against a real response. Do that before
building further on them.

## Ported code

The candidate finder and solve state machine are ports of lila's
`ui/analyse/src/nodeFinder.ts`, `ui/lib/src/ceval/winningChances.ts` and
`ui/analyse/src/retrospect/retroCtrl.ts`. Keep them recognisable — same function
names, same thresholds, same comments where they explain a magic number. When
lila changes a threshold we want the diff to be obvious.

Thresholds that are load-bearing and must not drift silently:
- candidate: `|povDiff('white', prev, curr)| > 0.1`, or prev was mate <= 3 and
  curr is not mate
- accept an alternative move: `povDiff(pov, yourEval, prevEval) > -0.04`

## Storage

- IndexedDB via `idb-keyval` for games, deck and solve history. One store per
  username.
- localStorage only for tiny prefs (last username, board theme). It is a
  separate, fixed ~5 MiB box, not a slice of the IndexedDB quota.
- Call `navigator.storage.persist()` once, or the browser LRU-evicts solve
  history under disk pressure.
- Raw game payloads are re-fetchable and may be purged. Derived puzzles and
  solve history are not and must not be.

## Cross-origin isolation

Multithreaded Stockfish needs `SharedArrayBuffer`, which needs COOP/COEP.
`public/_headers` carries them and Cloudflare Pages serves them. If
`crossOriginIsolated` is false the engine silently falls back to the
single-threaded build and the analysis pass becomes unusably slow — assert on it
rather than letting it degrade quietly.

## Licence

AGPL-3.0-or-later, because we port lila (AGPL) and use chessground (GPL-3). The
network clause means the running site must offer its source — the footer link to
the repo is not decoration, don't remove it.
